# House Prices Prediction with Random Forest Regressor


<p>This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict house prices using various features like size, location, year built, etc. The dataset comes from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</a> competition on Kaggle.</p>
<p>I've used the RandomForestRegressor from the Scikit-learn library and performed a thorough exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The project includes preprocessing techniques, data visualization, model training, and evaluation. The dataset is based on a Kaggle competition, where the aim is to predict house prices based on numerous features such as the number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and overall condition of the house.</p>

<h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data exploration and visualization using <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code>.</li>
    <li>Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical data encoding.</li>
    <li>Model training using the Random Forest algorithm from the <code>sklearn</code> library.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
<p>Clone the repository and ensure you have all the required libraries installed. Use the Jupyter notebook to run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.</p>
