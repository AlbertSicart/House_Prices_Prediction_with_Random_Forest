# House_Prices_Prediction_with_Random_Forest
This repository contains a comprehensive approach to predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques.

I've utilized the RandomForestRegressor from the Scikit-learn library and performed a thorough exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The project includes preprocessing techniques, data visualization, model training, and evaluation. The dataset is based on a Kaggle competition, where the aim is to predict house prices based on numerous features such as the number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and overall condition of the house.

Key Features:

Extensive EDA with visual plots and data insights.
Handling of missing values and one-hot encoding for categorical data.
Model evaluation using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R^2.
Feature importance visualization to understand key predictors.
This project is ideal for anyone aiming to understand the nuances of regression in machine learning and for those who want a foundational understanding of how to approach and solve a prediction problem.
